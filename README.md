# SkinCancer_Project_git
**SkinCancer\_Project\_git** is a machine learning project focused on detecting and classifying skin cancer from images using deep learning models, such as CNNs. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and possibly a user interface for diagnosis assistance.

SkinCancer_Project_git
A deep learning project for the detection and classification of skin cancer using image analysis techniques.

🧠 Overview
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify skin lesions into categories such as benign and malignant. The goal is to aid early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer through automated image analysis.

📁 Features
Image preprocessing and augmentation

CNN model training and evaluation

Use of public datasets (e.g., ISIC)

Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)

Optional GUI/web interface for predictions

🗂️ Dataset
We use the ISIC Skin Lesion Dataset, which includes dermoscopic images labeled for skin cancer types.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn
